# Medicare Hospital Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive dashboard analysis of Medicare Hospital data. The dashboard provides insights into various key metrics such as Bed Occupancy, Diagnosis Types, Doctor Feedback, Billing Amount, and Health Insurance versus Billing Amount trends over time.

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Admit, Discharge, and Follow-Up Dates:** The dashboard captures important patient information, including admit, discharge, and follow-up dates.
  
- **Bed Occupancy:** Displays the count of occupied beds categorized by type (Private, General, ICU).

- **Diagnosis Type:** Visualizes the distribution of diagnosis types across the patient base, including conditions like Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, and Fracture.

- **Doctor Feedback:** A donut chart represents the feedback received by different doctors from the patients.

- **Health Insurance vs. Billing Amount:** A line chart compares the health insurance amount with the sum of the billing amount over the months of the year.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** The primary tool used to create the interactive dashboard.
- **Excel:** The dataset was initially prepared and cleaned using Excel.
